# Welcome!

We're glad you're trying to contribute to Donate BTC. We're currently in development, but we are definitely accepting pull requests for new sites!

Please take a nice look at how our site works and get a feel for the routing stuff before contributing. Another thing you wanna learn the basics of is [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), as this CSS framework isn't known and used by much people you most likely don't know how it works. So we just ask that you take a scroll through the documentation of Chakra and learn the basics.

Another thing to note is that make sure your pull request doesn't conflict with our branch, or we will not merge your pull request. 

Please follow [this commit guide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/) for detailed instructions on how to format your commit messages.

If you need any support, please DM Matt and Geneva on Discord.
