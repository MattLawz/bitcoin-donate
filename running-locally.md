## Running locally in development mode

To get started, just clone the repository and run yarn:

`
git clone https://github.com/MattLawz/coinworks.git
`

`
yarn
`

`
yarn dev
`

*Don't forget to CD into the folder before running `yarn`*

**Note: You must use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), if you don't use Yarn then your packages will not work correctly and you will have a conflicting issue between Yarn and NPM.**

### Why we use yarn

Yarn is faster, more secure, stable, and more reliable than NPM. Yarn even fixes a lot of common issues with NPM.
